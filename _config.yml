    description: One of my earlier portfolio sites, this was built as a challenge for freeCodeCamp. I used Bootstrap 4 and kept the design very to the point with a single page layout.

  # Project
  - title: DiceRoller
    description: This was my first adventure in C#. I'd previously written a simple dice roller in JS and thought it was a great project to test the waters in a new language. I added a small easter egg when you roll 5 dice of the same number.

  # Project
  - title: InTouch
    description: InTouch is my current, actively-developing project. It's an application I've written for work, so I'm unable to share source code. The front-end is built with React and a combination of Material-UI, Ant Design, and custom components. API requests are proxied through a Node/Express backend to the ConnectWise Manage API. Authentication is managed with an Auth0 integration. Users are able to manage service requests and client information in a clean, fast UI that was designed with a mobile-first approach.
