I've created this personal portfolio site to showcase my projects and practice some of the things I've learned. It was designed in **Adobe XD**, built with **Jekyll**, and deployed with **Netlify**. I'm also using a Jekyll theme called [Popfolio](#) that I built specifically for this site.

When I'm not learning or writing code, I enjoy [woodworking](#), reading, wrenching on my [motorcycle project](#), and hanging out with [these guys](#).
